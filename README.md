# Install

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/Window5000/SuffixChanger/releases/latest) and add it to your ``plugins`` folder.

## Dependencies

This plugin obviously requires [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) to function.

For suffixes to show in chat you need another plugin to format the chat, for a simplistic formatter you can use [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315) and [VaultChatFormatter](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vaultchatformatter.49016)

# Usage

Create a group for each of your suffixes, then add them all to a track called ``suffixes``. Before players can change their suffix, you need to give them the permissions ``suffix.[group name of suffix]`` of every suffix they're allowed to use.

## Commands:
- ``/suffix`` Open the SuffixChanger GUI
- ``/reloadsuffixchanger`` Reloads the SuffixChanger config
- ``/addsuffix <group_name> <suffix...(use as many args here as you wish)>`` Add a group with the specified suffix to luckperms

## Permissions:
  - ``suffix.[group name of suffix]`` for every suffix the player is allowed to use
  - ``suffixchanger.suffix`` to open the GUI
  - ``suffixchanger.addsuffix`` to add suffixes via a command
  - ``suffixchanger.reload`` to reload the SuffixChanger config

# Configuration
  - ``title`` changes the title that is used for the GUI, supports [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)
  - ``watermark`` set to false to disable the watermark under the leftover buttons
  - ``obfuscate`` set to true to obfuscate suffixes that the players isn't allowed to use
