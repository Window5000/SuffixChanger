# Install

[Download the plugin](https://hangar.papermc.io/Window5/SuffixChanger) and add it to your ``plugins`` folder.

## Dependencies

This plugin obviously requires [LuckPerms]() to function.

# Usage

Create a group for each of your suffixes, then add them all to a track called ``suffix``
Before players can change their suffix, you need to give them the permissions ``sufx.[group name of suffix]`` of every suffix they're allowed to use.

## Permissions:
  - ``sufx.[group name of suffix]`` for every suffix the player is allowed to use
  - ``suffixchanger.suffix`` to open the GUI

# Configuration
  - ``watermark`` set to false to disable the watermark under the close button
  - ``obfuscate`` set to true to obfuscate suffixes that the players isn't allowed to use
